# My dotfile Management

This uses [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symbolic links to the configurations and dotfiles used to configure my environment. This will also install or update oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, brew, and the list of brew packages and casks.

## Use

Clone the repo, navigate into the folder that you cloned to, run the install script. This does expect VS Code to be installed and does not install it currently.

## Packages and configurations currently in this 

- Wezterm
- Amythest
- NVIM
- TMUX
- VS Code
- Hugo

There are a few more installed that I don't use anymore, but I have left them for now.

This also installs a couple fonts I use regularly and are utilized by the dotfiles listed here.
